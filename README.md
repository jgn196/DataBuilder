DataBuilder
===========

A .Net class library to make writing small binary data samples (suitable for unit testing) easy.

You use the DataBuilder class to generate data.

For more detailed information see the [Project Help Pages](http://jgn196.github.io/DataBuilder).

If you prefer you can build the help pages from the Visual Studio help project in the solution. 
This requires the Sandcastle tools.

The library targets .NET 4.5.
